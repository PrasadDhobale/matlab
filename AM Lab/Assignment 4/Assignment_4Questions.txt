x is 0 2 pi/3 with interval of pi/30 
y is sinx + rand(size(x))/100
Plot  x vs y with any marker symbol use basic fitting to do a quadratic and cubic fitting.

The following data is obtained from an experiement aimed at measuring the spring constraint of a given string different masses m are hang from 
the spring and corresponding reflection dell of the spring from its unstretched configuration are measured
f = kd
f = mg.
mg = kd
m = [    ]
d = [    ]
g = 9.8
